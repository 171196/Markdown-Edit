There's something hopeful and exciting about a blank page. The promise
of new journeys, discovery and purpose. And yet when I open a program
like Microsoft Word, I'm assaulted with menus and ribbons and decisions
about font size and colors and layouts. That's not for me. Content is
what I value. That's why I write in Markdown. And it's why I wrote
Markdown Edit.

*More to come*
