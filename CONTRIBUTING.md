# Contributor Guidelines

There are a number of ways to contribute:

  - Bug Reports: Yep, they happen and it's important catalog them for further investigation. Please use the Issues feature here in Github to report problems.
  - Feature Requests: Got an idea for a feature. Open an issue. That way we can all see and comment on it.
  - Pull Requests: Please check with me before you write something. I may already be working on that feature. Don't be surprised if I extensively edit your pull request. I'm anal that way. (I'm also a ReSharper freak).
  - Fix My Prose: Dammit Jim, I'm a programmer, not an English major.
  - Snippets, Templates, and Themes: Got a cool theme or some killer snippets? Send them to me. Better yet, open an issue and put them there so we can all see and comment on them.
  - Logo - Something that incorporates the current icon with the name. [insert *Dammit Jim* text here]
  - Write a review (a nice one I hope)
