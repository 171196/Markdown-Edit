## About

### Markdown Edit

Version 0.1.0  
Copyright (c) Mike Ward, All rights reserved.

## User Settings

User settings are stored in a text file the the AppData folder. Placing settings in a plain file allows sharing of settings on different installations.

Typically, this folder is located at `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Markdown Edit\user_settings.json`. Pressing `F9` will open this file in the system's Notepad editor. It should look something like this:

    {
        "EditorBackground": "#F7F4EF",
        "EditorForeground": "Black",
        "EditorFontFamily": "Segoe UI",
        "EditorFontSize": 14.0
    }

When you change settings and save this file, Markdown Edit will immediately update to reflect the changes.

Colors can be defined as RBG values, like the `EditorBackground` setting, or using the predefined names, like the `EditorForground' setting. Acceptable predefined names are listed [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.colors(v=vs.110).aspx).

If you delete this file, Markdown Edit will restore it.

## User Template

You can change the appearance of the preview view by changing the user template file. User templates work similar to user settings. The template file is stored in the AppData Folder by the name of `user_template.html`. Edit it has you see fit. Delete it and Markdown Edit will create a new one.

**Changes do not take affect until you restart Markdown Edit**
