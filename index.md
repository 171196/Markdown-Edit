Markdown Edit is a Windows desktop [CommonMark] (a.k.a. Markdown) editor
with an emphasis on content and keyboard shortcuts. There is minimal
window chrome and most functions are accessed through keyboard
shortcuts. There is no main menu, status bar, tabbed windows or other
distractions.

### Reviews

[Beta News] – "Markdown Edit is far more capable than it looks"

[Download Crew] – "An excellent Markdown editor which doesn't get in
your way"

[Softpedia] – "It comes with all the options that you would expect from
such an application, but what makes it stand out from the crowd is the
minimalistic, stylish-looking interface"
