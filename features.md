The [Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers)
defines the term **feature** in [IEEE
829](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IEEE_829) as "A distinguishing
characteristic of a software item (e.g., performance, portability, or
functionality)."

-   Open `.html` and `.docx` (Microsoft Word) files. They're converted
    to Markdown auto-magically.

-   Drag & drop to open files (yep, the conversion thing works for drag
    & drop).

-   Upload images to Imgur using drag & drop. [Video
    Examples](http://mike-ward.net/2015/03/31/markdown-edit-1-4-imgur-uploads/)

-   Keyboard snippets. Capture those frequently entered items into quick
    keyboard shortcuts.

-   Make your Markdown beautiful. `Alt+F` will reformat your Markdown
    and wrap it to 80 columns.

    > "A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as
    > plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or
    > formatting instructions"

-   A real editor, not a watered down text-area or rich-text control
    (Thank you [Avalon Edit](http://avalonedit.net/))

-   Loads fast

-   Accurate syntax highlighting. MDE uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
    to decide how to color highlight a document. Other editors use
    regular expressions that don't correctly interpret the multi-line
    block nature of Markdown.

-   Live preview and user defined templates

-   User settable fonts, colors, themes

-   Word count, auto save, find and replace (including
    regular expressions)

-   As you type spell checking

-   Quickly open recent files

-   Remember last cursor position when opening file (optional)

-   Quickly navigate to the next or previous header (`Ctrl+J` `Ctrl+U`)

-   CommonMark and GitHub Markdown

-   Modern UI with minimal distractions

-   Open Source
