Here's some cool stuff (in no particular order) in Markdown Edit

-   Make your Markdown beautiful. `Alt+F` will reformat your Markdown
    and wrap it to 80 columns.

-   A real editor, not a watered down textarea or rich text control

    to decide color highlight your document. Other editors use regular
    expressions, which can't understand the multi-line block nature
    of Markdown.
