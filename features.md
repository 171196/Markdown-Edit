Here's some cool stuff about Markdown Edit (in no particular order).

-   Open `.html` and `.docx` (Microsoft Word) files. They're converted
    to Markdown *auto-magically*.

-   Drag & drop to open files (yep, the conversion thing works for drag
    & drop).

-   Upload images to Imgur using drag & drop. [Video
    Examples](http://mike-ward.net/2015/03/31/markdown-edit-1-4-imgur-uploads/)

-   Make your Markdown beautiful. `Alt+F` will reformat your Markdown
    and wrap it to 80 columns.

    > text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or
    > formatting instructions ."[John Gruber - Markdown's
    > creator](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

-   A real editor, not a watered down textarea or rich text control
    (Thank you [Avalon Edit](http://avalonedit.net/))

-   Loads fast - My goal was to make it open as fast as Windows built-in
    Notepad program. While that's next to impossible given the
    technologies and features in MDE, I didn't miss by much.

-   Accurate syntax highlighting. MDE uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
    to decide how to color highlight a document. Other editors use
    regular expressions that don't correctly interpret the multi-line
    block nature of Markdown.
