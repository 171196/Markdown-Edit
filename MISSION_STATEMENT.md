## Mission Statement

Markdown Edit is a low distraction Windows desktop editor for authoring Markdown documents based on the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) standard. The aim is to provide a helpful but not overly friendly environment. The user is assumed to be competent at using text editors. As such, an emphasis is placed on keyboard shortcuts. Dialogs, status indicators and menus are minimal or removed to promote focus on editing tasks. 

Markdown Edit *may* support other dialects of Markdown. Other *Markdown-like* languages may be supported depending on applicability and community feedback.

The Markdown Edit project is open to all and your participation at any level is encouraged.
